# Pattern Generator Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`pattern.ipynb`) demonstrating the generation of various patterns using Python. It's designed to help beginners understand the logic behind nested loops, conditionals, and basic programming constructs by building visual patterns such as stars (`*`), numbers, or custom characters.

## 📚 Contents

The notebook includes:

- ⭐ Star Patterns (Pyramid, Diamond, Right/Left Triangle, etc.)
- 🔢 Number Patterns (Incremental sequences, Pascal's Triangle, etc.)
- 🌀 Mixed Patterns (Alphanumeric, hollow shapes, etc.)
- 🧠 Logical reasoning patterns (used in coding interviews)

Each pattern includes:
- Code implementation in Python
- Output visualization in the notebook
- Step-by-step comments for understanding

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Optional: VS Code or any IDE with Jupyter support

You can install the required tools via:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

Then run:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download `pattern.ipynb`.
2. Open the notebook with Jupyter.
3. Execute each cell using `Shift + Enter`.
4. Modify the parameters (e.g., number of rows, symbols) to explore different patterns.

## 🧑‍💻 Ideal For

- Students learning Python
- Candidates preparing for coding interviews
- Hobbyists who enjoy visual logic problems
